# Introduction to Logic
><span style="font-size: 1.2em"> **Logic** - anatomy of thoughts. </span>

><span style="font-size: 1.2em"> **Argument** - series of statements called **premises**
intended to determine the truth of another statement, that is named **conclusion**  </span>

Claim is some statement. Argument supports some claim and  consists of premises and conclusions.  

An argument is **LOGICALLY** valid if and only if it takes a form that makes it impossible for the conclusion to be false if premises are true.

_For example:_
- **Valid argument**: If there is an earthquake, the detector will send a message. No message has been sent. So there is no earthquake.
- **Invalid Argument**: Whenever Anil is here, Kumar is also here. Anil is not here, so Kumar is not here.

## Analyzing arguments
1. Identify the argument. _(is this an argument?)_
2. Reconstruct the argument _(what the premises and conclusions?)_
3. Evaluate the argument. _(simplify, point out what is good and what is bad)_

An *extended argument* is an argument that is made up of two or more other sub-arguments.

## Ambiguity
A sentence is ambiguous in a given context when there is more than one possible way of interpreting it in that context

- Lexical ambiguity. *He is looking for a match*
- Sentence ambiguity. *33-year old Mrs. Jones admitted to dangerous driving in Leeds Crown Court yesterday*.
